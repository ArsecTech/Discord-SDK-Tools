    An Application to Control Discord Activity (RPC)
  </p>
</div>
<br />

## About The Project

This project interacts with Discord App with Discord Game SDK to control RPC ( Activity ) like a game. <br />
It uses %APPDATA% Env to save activities, and it can launch them whenever we want.

**Abilities** :
* Add Activity
* Remove Activity
* Modify Activity
* Show Listed Activities
* Launch Activity

## Getting Started

This tool is CLI ( Command Line Interface ) and uses color for better UI. <br />
It has issues in systems that doesn't support ANSI Colors, to fix the issue, execute this command in the Command Prompt:

```
REG ADD HKCU\CONSOLE /f /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```

## Building

For Building the project from source, You need to have ![Nlohmann JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) Library downloaded by vcpkg
and specify `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` while building it.

## Installation

This tool is only available for Windows because the library doesn't support linux OS.
You can use ![Releases](https://github.com/iHapiW/Discord-SDK-Tools/releases) to download binaries.

## Step by Step Usage

Before you add your activity into list. You need to create it in Discord.

Go through ![Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), Then click "New Application" <br />
Then Enter a Name for it ( This will be shown in Title of your Activity )

Copy the "Application ID" here.

Then go to "Art Assets" tab under the "Rich Presence" <br />

Upload 2 pictures:
* Big Picture
* Small Picture

**Now that im writing README Discord has some issues and wont save your pictures at first upload.** <br />
**So you need to upload your pictures first, then refresh multiple times and upload again. untill you see your pictures exist after upload**

Then go ahead open the application and go through "Add Activity" inside "Configure Activities" menu.<br />
Enter the Activity Info, then launch it.

Done, You Launched It ðŸŒŸ
